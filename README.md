# Soul Shards Despawn

Ever wanted to create your own mob spawners? Now you can!

## Information

This is a fan continuation of the popular 1.4.7
mod, [Soul Shards](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1285901-1-6-4-forgeirc-v1-0-18-soul-shards-v2-0-15-and#soulshards).

This version of the mod is based on the sources
of [Soul Shards Respawn](https://github.com/TehNut-Mods/Soul-Shards-Respawn), which itself is based
on [Soul Shards: Reborn by Moze_Intel](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/wip-mods/1445947-1-7-10-soul-shards-reborn-original-soul-shards)
and [Soul Shards: The Old Ways by Team Whammich](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/2329877-soul-shards-the-old-ways-rc9-update).

This version is a near direct clone of the original mod.

All configuration options for Respawn also work for this mod. See
the [Respawn Wiki](https://github.com/TehNut/Soul-Shards-Respawn/wiki) for more information.
